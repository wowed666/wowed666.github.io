title: Blog Post 3 Fake News Detector
---


In this blog we are going to build a Fake News Detector model by machine learning.

# Data source
Our data for this tutorial comes from the article
- Ahmed H, Traore I, Saad S. (2017) “Detection of Online Fake News Using N-Gram Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques. In: Traore I., Woungang I., Awad A. (eds) Intelligent, Secure, and Dependable Systems in Distributed and Cloud Environments. ISDDC 2017. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 10618. Springer, Cham (pp. 127-138).


## Import Modules And Acquire Training Data

Firstly let's import the modules we will need!

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import re
import string

from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import losses

from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import StringLookup

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# for embedding viz
import plotly.express as px 
import plotly.io as pio
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"
```

Then let's Acquire Training Data! And take a peek.

```python
train_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_train.csv?raw=true"
df = pd.read_csv(train_url)
df.head()
```
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right">
      <th></th>
      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>
      <th>title</th>
      <th>text</th>
      <th>fake</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>17366</td>

      <td>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday...</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>5634</td>
      <td>Trump says Pence will lead voter fraud panel</td>
      <td>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.President Donald Trump sa...</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>17487</td>
      <td>JUST IN: SUSPECTED LEAKER and “Close Confidant...</td>
      <td>On December 5, 2017, Circa s Sara Carter warne...</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>12217</td>
      <td>Thyssenkrupp has offered help to Argentina ove...</td>
      <td>Germany s Thyssenkrupp, has offered assistance...</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>5535</td>
      <td>Trump say appeals court decision on travel ban...</td>
      <td>President Donald Trump on Thursday called the ...</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
There are four columns in our dataframe. 
- "0" column looks like nonsense we can just skip.
- "title" column is the title of the news.
- "text" column is the content of news.
- "fake" column let us know whether this news is fake.("0" present it is not fake news; "1" present it is fake news!)
