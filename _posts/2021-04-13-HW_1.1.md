title: Interactive Visualizations using NOAA Climate Data
---

In this post I will be demonstrating the functions I wrote to query climate data from the NOAA and create interactive visualizations.


## Create a Database

Import some necessary package:  'sqlite3' creates the database and queries data
								'pandas' to manipulates dataframes.

```python
qimport pandas as pd

# advanced plotting tools for data frames
# basically a bunch of matplotlib shortcuts
import seaborn as sns 

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sqlite3

```
