1. Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 

Overall, we have implemented a local app which can store photo of clothes owned by users and recommend what to wear (top, bottom, and shoes) daily.

2. What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 

Kefan: The thing I am most proud of is that my app did help me sort out clothes and recommended me clothes combinations that I think are very fashionable.
Kefan: I use various apps on my computer and mobile phones every day, but this is the first time I have implemented an app by myself, and I think it is very useful.

3. What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.) 

Our design idea is actually more suitable for users to use on mobile phones. We have two ways to improve:
The first method: Turn this local app into a web app so that users can use it not only on the computer, but also on the mobile phone.
The second method: Make this app a mobile application (you can download it from the App store or Google store), but we need to learn a new programming language

4. How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)

Looking at it now, our proposal is too ambitious. There are several things we mentioned in the proposal, but they were not completed. 1. We originally planned to involve some NLP content, such as analyzing what style of clothes people like to wear nowadays, what color combination is the most popular, etc. through news and social media. 2. We originally planned that our app can save the user's clothes information, but our current work requires the user to re-upload all clothes every time the app is opened.

5. What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 
1. We build our UI with pyQt5 package, it is a very good package to built an UI. We learned how to connect an event to a button, display images in UI, get the imformation from user.

2. We build our mechine learning model with TensworFlow. 


6. How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.

We build and train some mechine learning models to help us to identify the images of cloth. We learned a lot of knowlegeds about how to built a mechine learning model such as: data collection and cleaning, prepare trainning,testing,validation dataset. 
construct a machine learning model and train it, imporve machine learning model. This is a very valueable experience for my future career related to data sicence and machine learning.
