# How to visualize Data ?

Firstly we import  `pandas`  package and  `pyplot`  module.
```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

```
- `pandas` is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.
We use `pandas` to munipulate our data.

- we use `pyplot` to plot our data. 

## Step 1

We use `pd.read_csv` read data from url assign the data as `dataframe` type to our variable "penguins"


```python

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

```
## Step 2
We define a fig and ax.
If we are interested in how does Culmen Depth and Culmen Length distribute in different Species.
- We can define a "plot" funtion.This function has a dataframe type parameter. "Culmen Length" as x ;
"Culmen Depth" as y. Use `ax.scatter` plot the dots in ax with the data x and y. And set label as Species name. 
- We can use `groupby "Species"` make "Species" as index pass our plot function.This way can avoid for loop or duplicate code


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)

def plot(df):
    x = df["Culmen Length (mm)"] 
    y = df["Culmen Depth (mm)"] 

    ax.scatter(x,y,label = df["Species"].iloc[0])
    
penguins.groupby(["Species"]).apply(plot)     

```
## Step 3
Our plot is ready! Then we just need set the labels and legend of our ax.

```python

ax.set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)", ylabel ="Culmen Depth (mm)")
ax.legend()
fig   

```
As you can see, blue dots present the Adelie Penguin; 
orange dots present the Chinstrap Penguin; 
green dots present the Gentoo Penguin.

Now we can easily observe penguins' Culmen Depth and Culmen Length distribute in different Species.
