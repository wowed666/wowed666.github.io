title: Blog Post 2 Spectral Clustering
---



In this post I will be guiding you through the process of creating a simple spectral clustering algorithm.
Spectral clustering allows us to find similarities in data points.
In this simple tutorial, we will understand how to partition data into their natural clusters.


## Introduction

In this part we'll study *spectral clustering*. Spectral clustering is an important tool for identifying meaningful
parts of data sets with complex structure. To start, let's look at an example where we *don't* need spectral clustering. 

 
Firstly let's import the package that we'll need!

```python


import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


```
